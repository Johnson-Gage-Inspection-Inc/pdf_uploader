## Overview

The pdfuploader project is designed to simplify the process of uploading scanned documents to Qualer. It features a robust architecture with key components such as file processing tools, connectivity checks, and archive management. The project aims to provide a seamless user experience by handling various scenarios, including successful uploads, failed uploads, and file renaming, while ensuring compatibility across different environments and platforms.

##  Features

|      | Feature         | Summary       |
| :--- | :---:           | :---          |

| **PDF Correction** |  *   Backup OCR if not provided by the scanner.  *   Ensure PDFs are upright by detecting and correcting orientation.  *   Split multi-page PDFs into separate files when a new work order number is detected.|

| **Automatic Triggers** |  *   Automatically watch directories for new PDFs.  *   Identify document type based on source, contents, or filename.  *   Archive or delete processed files based on settings.  *   Handle file renaming to avoid conflicts.|
| **Integration** |  *   Upload PDFs to the Qualer API with detailed logging.  *   Retry and resolve naming conflicts during uploads. |

| ‚öôÔ∏è **Architecture** |  *   Modular design with separate modules for API gateway, file processing, and configuration.  *   Utilizes a centralized `config.py` file for configuration data.  *   Employs an error handling system using `cp.red`.  *   Supports live or staging API usage, file uploads or skips, and deletion or archiving of processed files. |
| üìö **Documentation** |  *   Provides detailed documentation for each module, including script instructions, functions, and error handling mechanisms.  *   Includes a comprehensive overview of the project's architecture and functionality.  *   Offers concise response guidelines for user interactions.  *   Utilizes Markdown formatting for easy readability. |
| üìä **Data Processing** |  *   Employs data processing techniques to extract relevant pages from PDFs, including `extract`, `workorders`, and `create_child_pdf` functions.  *   Supports file rename errors using the `try_rename` function.  *   Utilizes an API token to fetch service orders and update a dictionary of purchase orders (POs).  *   Compresses data for storage in compressed JSON files. |
| üåê **Connectivity** |  *   Verifies internet availability by pinging Google's address.  *   Checks accessibility of SharePoint and Qualer servers.  *   Verifies the existence of the SharePoint directory.  *   Provides real-time feedback on system connections for informed decision-making. |
| üíª **Development Tools** |  *   Utilizes Python as the primary programming language.  *   Employs the `colorama` library for colorized logging.  *   Incorporates PyInstaller for packaging and deployment.  *   Supports PyMPDF, PDF, Pillow, and PdF2Imagick libraries for PDF processing. |
| üìÅ **Configuration** |  *   Utilizes a centralized `config.py` file for configuration data.  *   Configures API endpoints, directory paths, and upload settings for the project.  *   Specifies document types for Qualer API uploads.  *   Offers live or staging API usage options. |

Please note that this table is not exhaustive, but it highlights some of the key features and technologies used in the `pdf_uploader` project.

##  Getting Started

If you're just here to download and use the program, please download the latest release from [https://github.com/Johnson-Gage-Inspection-Inc/pdf_uploader/releases/latest].  The instructions from this section are about building from source. 

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Before getting started with pdf_uploader, ensure your runtime environment meets the following requirements:

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Package Manager:** Pip 


###  Installation

Install pdf_uploader using one of the following methods:

**Build from source:**

1. Clone the pdf_uploader repository:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Johnson-Gage-Inspection-Inc/pdf_uploader
  ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```sh
  cd pdf_uploader
  ```
3. Prepare a virtual environment

  + Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

  + Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
    myenv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```
      
  + Install the project dependencies:

    **Using `pip`** &nbsp; [<img align="center" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Pip-3776AB.svg?style={badge_style}&logo=pypi&logoColor=white" />](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

  + (Optional) Verify the setup:

    ```sh
    python -m pip list
    ```

4. Configure your project
  See [configuration](#configuration).

5. (Optional) Compile a standalone executable using `pyinstaller`:
  With the virtual environment still active, you can compile a binary using `pyinstaller`

  ```
  pyinstaller --onefile --clean \
    --add-data "myenv/Lib/site-packages/pypdfium2_raw/pdfium.dll;pypdfium2_raw" \
    --add-data "myenv/Lib/site-packages/pypdfium2_raw/version.json;pypdfium2_raw" \
    --add-data "myenv/Lib/site-packages/pypdfium2/version.json;pypdfium2" \
    --add-data ".env;." --add-data "app/dict.json.gz;app" \
    --name PDF_Uploader watcher.py
  ```
  Creating a standalone executable ensures the program can run without requiring Python, dependencies, or credentials on the target system.  Alternatively, you can simply download the latest release from [https://github.com/Johnson-Gage-Inspection-Inc/pdf_uploader/releases/latest], precompiled.

---

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to securely store sensitive credentials. Add the following content:
    ```
    QUALER_USER=your_qualer_username
    QUALER_PASS=your_qualer_password
    ```

    This user must at least have the API security role in [Employee Settings](https://jgiquality.qualer.com/Company/Employees) on Qualer.

## Usage

### Starting the program:

Choose one:
  #### Run with Python:

    1. Activate the virtual environment:
      ```sh
      source myenv/bin/activate # Linux/Mac
      ```
      or
      ```sh
      myenv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
      ```
    2. Run pdf_uploader using the following command:

      ```sh
      python watcher.py
      ```

  #### Run executable:

    ```sh
    PDF_Uploader.exe
    ```

### Operation Overview

The `pdf_uploader` script automates the processing and categorization of scanned PDF files based on their filenames, content, and designated scanner output paths.


1. **Scanner Configuration** (As of _1/18/25_):

   - **General Documents**: Scanned by a dedicated scanner and saved to:

     ```
     /OneDrive - Johnson Gage and Inspection, Inc/Shared with Everyone/access/!!! Front Office Scanned Docs - HOLDING
     ```

   - **Order Certificates**: Scanned by another scanner and saved to:

     ```
     /OneDrive - Johnson Gage and Inspection, Inc/Shared with Everyone/access/!!! Scanned External Certs
     ```



2. **Document Categorization**:

   - Based on internal naming conventions and business logic, documents are categorized into:
     - **Purchase Orders (POs)**: Likely associated with customer orders.

     - **Service Orders (SOs)**: Possibly internal or external service-related documents.

     - **Shippers**: May pertain to shipment confirmations or delivery notes.



3. **File Processing Logic**:

   - The script scans the file path and content to determine the document type:

     - Files scanned from the **General Documents** folder are treated as miscellaneous files unless their filenames or content indicate otherwise.

     - Files scanned from the **Order Certificates** folder are more likely to be categorized as POs or related documents.

   - The filename is adjusted as needed to resolve conflicts or provide additional context.



4. **Error Handling and Upload**:

   - If a file cannot be uploaded due to naming conflicts, content mismatches, or system errors, the script logs the issue for review.

   - Successfully processed files are archived or moved based on their outcome.



5. **Automatic Reorganization**:

   - Processed files are moved to designated directories:
     - **Accepted Files**: Stored in an archive directory after successful uploads.

     - **Rejected Files**: Stored in a rejection directory for further investigation.
